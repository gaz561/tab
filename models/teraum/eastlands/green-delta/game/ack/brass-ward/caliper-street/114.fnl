 :description "This is Broken Baubels, a store in the Brass Ward of the human metropolis of Ack. A rather unpopular shop, Broken Baubels sells relics of the prosperous and wonderous times before magic Broke. Glass displays are cluttered with broken lumorbs, non-functional pocket dragons, and other trinkets from the Magic Revolution. In the back corner is an autohearth, cast iron pipes rising out of it and penetrating the ceiling."
