# Introduction to TAB

TAB is a system for structuring information to allow computed analysis & manipulation.

TAB uses the Fennel programming language to establish a set of constructs to provide a framework for operations: A *thing* is *made* from a *model* defining the thing's *attributes* and *behaviors*.

*(For the sake of making saving and loading data to the computer easier, behaviors are kept in separate files from attributes.)*
