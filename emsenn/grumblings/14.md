# What we've got & what we're doing

I'm not entirely comfortable with the paradigm I'm holding going into this post, but I can't put a finger to why not, so I'm going to go ahead.

I'm going to share what it is we (me and Es) have, and what it is we're doing, and maybe a bit about what we would be doing if we had the time.

First I guess let me say, right now me and s are the two like, active local Groundhogs. Before we got displaced out of Cottenboro, there were a few more of us, and what made someone a Groundhog was their agreement to act on a set of beliefs we'd written out together.

Since we moved, we havent gotten much activity from folk we tried to involve in the project, so things, including our beliefs, have gotten kind of muddy. But I think its fair to say that we still center Black & Indigenous liberation, through the action of ending food apartheid. Hopefully, if asked, I could explain how anything I'm working on in my day relates back to these efforts. But again, I've been burnt out for a while, so please, ask explicitly if y'all think I'm off the road.

So... what do we have?

In the physical world, we have what I've been calling the 561 Garden (5=E, 6=F, 1=A; EFA = End Food Apartheid) and the Burrow.

In the virtual world, we have a Twitter account that Es handles, this forum, and I'm working on what's traditionally called a MUD - dont worry about that for now.

The garden has a few different areas. There's up on the porch where we grow houseplants and have space for propagating fruit tree cuttings and stuff like that. There's also areas of perennials that we are cultivating to divide & share. There's areas where we grow a polyculture of annuals, with the goal of collecting seed to continue to develop those crops for our locality. There's also succulents scattered around that are for propagating & dividing & sharing too.

We've also got a few things planted out properly, like muscadine grapes, picklemelons, prickly pear - those are for harvesting and processing & sharing.

Oh - theres also a compost heap in the back, though its not well managed at the moment because it recently got moved to appease the nuisance complaint, and we're trying to worm farming but I got too busy, maggots got added to the bin, and its been a struggle to get it back in order.

(As you can see, we have a lot, which means if we're doing all the things we can do, even in the garden, it leads to a very very busy day.)

Inside, we have the lending library, a large loom, several smaller looms, tools for crochet, knitting, herb drying racks, a food dehydrator, popcorn maker, beadworking supplies, stuff to brew ginger beer, stuff to make kombucha (oh yea - we grow/propagate tea bushes in the garden), stuff to recycle paper into pulp & then turn that pulp back into fresh paper, and... probably more stuff that I'm not thinking of.

Again - we've got more opportunities available to do stuff that'll help build local community than we actually have hours in the day.

Es works a job, at a local bookstore, and that covers our personal finances, and leaves me free to focus on making dirt and building the GAZ. (Which, again, I have been bad at, not that I reckon most folk couldve done better.)

Oh - I'm not sure how to fit this in but because Es and me live in the Burrow, our life is integrated into it, which means we've made choices like, we do our dishes by hand with a series of basins, outside, so the water can go into the garden.


Hmm... I think what I need to say now is that... the... holistic? nature of what we're trying is often one of our bigger inhibitions. Typed out like it was above, each of these looks like a distinct, atomic project, but in my head, I feel them all as part of a tapestry that can build a free life, like, one that doesnt rely on settler
