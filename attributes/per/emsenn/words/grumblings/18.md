# Sorghum, mustard, and crotalaria, oh my! (Whats the GAZ #8)

...That title doesn't work too well, but oh well.

I went through our seed inventory and glossing over stuff like "we have a lot of peas and brassicas to plant soon" - focusing on apparent summer crops - here's the list of what I got, sorted by the days to "mature," which could either mean until its an edible thing (in the case of the radishes and lettuce and such) or when it goes back to seed (for things like the mustards)


```lisp
{27 ["radish, icicle"]
 30 ["radish, crimson giant"]
 45 ["poppy, cali orange" "cilantro" "lettuce, black-seeded simpson"]
 50 ["spinach, matador"]
 55 ["turnip"]
 60 ["bean, gaz bush"]
 75 ["amaranth, hopi red dye" "parsley" "carrots" "beets, detriot red"]
 80 ["boneset" "zinnea"]
 90 ["sunn hemp" "mustard, old-fashioned" "mustard, green wave"]
 95 ["mustard, black"]
 99 ["sorghum, black amber"]
 ```
 
So obviously my first priority is the sorghum - I should've gotten that planted a few days ago at least! Oh well. Next is the various mustards, and sunn hemp (crotalaria). then I can take a day or two off, plant the amaranth, carrots, and beets, take another break, plant the beans, turnips, and spinach, and then finally plant the radishes, poppy and lettuce.
 
Actually, given how fast the radishes and lettuces and stuff are - and how I have enough seed for them, I should try and plant some of them as I'm planting the mustards.
 
So:

What this doesn't cover is where I'm going to plant each of these...



| Plant      | Location(s)                                      |
|------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Sorghum    | Just south of the existing sorghum               |
| Mustard    | Southern row of beds & east of central sugargum  |
| Crotalaria | Southeastern tiny triangle & triangle near porch |
| Radishes   | Same                                             |
| Lettuce    | Same                                             |
| Amaranth   | Main crop beds                                   |
| Carrots    | Same as radishes                                 |
| Beets      | Same                                             |
| Beans      | Wherever                                         |
| Turnips    | Same as turnips                                  |
| Spinach    | Same as sorghum                                  |


Now these might change - tonight I wanna look up the allelopathic relationships between these plants - do any inhibit the germination/growth of others? If so, avoid plnating them near each other. (I have been bad about this, since setting up the 561 Garden, and need to do better.)

But this is roughly the plan. If you see a way you want to involve yourself, let me know!
