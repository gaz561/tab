# Looking at allelopathy

Wow this information is not organized on the Internet, nor is it seemingly much-researched!

It looks like basically, among the common garden stuff, it can be generalized, plant grains in one place, plant roots & greens in another, and plant fruiting veggies in another, and it looks like beans can go anyplace except with fruiting veggies. (This is very generalized and probably not great advice, but seems better than no planning at all. And gives a foundation for advancing to a localized 'milpa' system)

That gives us the following groupings, among the seeds I'm planning to plant:

- amaranth, sorghum, corn, bean
- mustard, carrots, beets, bean, turnip, spinach, lettuce, radish

No fruiting veggies to plant this late in the season!

Sounds like it'd probably be best to make the smaller beds the grain beds and the bigger beds the... crop beds? Still trying to figure out the lingo.

I don't know how the following fit into that:

- crotalaria, boneset, zinnea, poppy, cilantro, parsley

At a glance, it looks like herbs and flowers should be treated like fruiting veggies.

Also, in looking this stuff up I realized I didn't account any of the seeds I've harvested so far this year! I should go back and do that tomorrow when I can't garden. Mostly its flowers, but there's also onions! Which should go with the greens & roots group.

So, tomorrow, get that sorghum planted!
